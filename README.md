# Car Dealership

## Description of the Project

In this program you are able to view cars, add cars, remove cars, and view all the cars.
It saves everything in a text file so the cars will not be lost when you close the application.
## User Stories

- I should, as a user, want the application to be centered from a single main entry point, so that I am able to just run the program.
- I should, as a user, get to view a menu on the screen where I can choose what action to take in the dealership application.
- I should, as a user, get the system to store information regarding vehicles and dealerships, so that my information is structured and can be reused subsequently.
- I should, as a user, I want the system to save and load car information from a file, so that dealership stock is preserved between sessions.
- I should, as a user, want to delete, add, and search for cars, so that I can manage the dealership's stock in a convenient way.
